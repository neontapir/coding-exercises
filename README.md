# coding-exercises
Repository for coding exercises, intended for technical interviews

Be sure to use `git clone --recursive` so that you get any submodule tests like the java refactoring test as well.

Each subfolder is a separate test with separate instructions. Look for a README file in the appropriate subfolder.
